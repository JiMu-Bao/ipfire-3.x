summary    = A tool for creating scanners (text pattern recognizers).

description
	The flex program generates scanners. Scanners are programs which can
	recognize lexical patterns in text. Flex takes pairs of regular
	expressions and C code as input and generates a C source file as
	output.  The output file is compiled and linked with a library to
	produce an executable.  The executable searches through its input for
	occurrences of the regular expressions. When a match is found, it
	executes the corresponding C code. Flex was designed to work with
	both Yacc and Bison, and is used by many programs as part of their
	build process.
